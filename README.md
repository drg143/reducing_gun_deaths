# reducing_gun_deaths

This project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine patterns in gun-related deaths in the United States.  
The analysis focuses on **intent, race, sex, and seasonality** to identify meaningful trends in the data.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Grouping and summarizing data
- Creating clear visualizations
- Communicating findings in plain language
